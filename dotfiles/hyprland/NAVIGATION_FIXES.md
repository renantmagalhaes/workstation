# Hyprland Navigation Fixes

## ✅ **Fixed Navigation Issues**

### 🎯 **Alt+Enter Shortcut**

- **BSPWM**: `super + Return` → Send window to next monitor
- **Hyprland**: `ALT + Return` → Send window to next monitor
- **Status**: ✅ **FIXED**

### 🖥️ **Dual Monitor Workspace Navigation**

- **BSPWM**: `super + ctrl + left/right` → Navigate between workspaces
- **Hyprland**: `super + ctrl + left/right` → Navigate between workspaces
- **Status**: ✅ **FIXED**

### 📱 **Window Movement Between Workspaces**

- **BSPWM**: `super + ctrl + shift + left/right` → Move window between workspaces
- **Hyprland**: `super + ctrl + shift + left/right` → Move window between workspaces
- **Status**: ✅ **FIXED**

### 🔄 **Focus Sync (Dual Monitor)**

- **BSPWM**: `super + 1-5` → Focus both monitors simultaneously
- **Hyprland**: `super + 1-5` → Focus both monitors simultaneously
- **Status**: ✅ **FIXED**

## 🎯 **Workspace Numbers Analysis**

### **Your BSPWM Setup:**

- **DP-1 (Primary)**: Workspaces 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- **HDMI-1 (Secondary)**: Workspaces 11, 22, 33, 44, 55

### **Hyprland Configuration:**

- **DP-1**: Workspaces 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- **HDMI-1**: Workspaces 11, 22, 33, 44, 55

### **Focus Sync Behavior:**

- `Super + 1` → Focus workspace 1 (DP-1) AND workspace 11 (HDMI-1)
- `Super + 2` → Focus workspace 2 (DP-1) AND workspace 22 (HDMI-1)
- `Super + 3` → Focus workspace 3 (DP-1) AND workspace 33 (HDMI-1)
- `Super + 4` → Focus workspace 4 (DP-1) AND workspace 44 (HDMI-1)
- `Super + 5` → Focus workspace 5 (DP-1) AND workspace 55 (HDMI-1)

## ✅ **Workspace Numbers Make Sense**

Your workspace numbering system is **perfect** for dual monitor setups:

1. **Logical Grouping**: Primary monitor (1-5) and secondary monitor (11-55)
2. **Easy Navigation**: Clear distinction between monitors
3. **Focus Sync**: Allows focusing both monitors with single keypress
4. **Intuitive**: Numbers correspond to monitor position (1 = first, 11 = second)

## 🎮 **Navigation Summary**

### **Window Management:**

- `Ctrl + Alt + T` → Open terminal
- `Super + Arrow` → Move focus between windows
- `Super + Shift + Arrow` → Move window
- `Super + Alt + Arrow` → Resize window
- `Alt + Return` → Send window to next monitor

### **Workspace Management:**

- `Super + 1-5` → Focus both monitors (workspace 1 + 11, etc.)
- `Super + Shift + 1-5` → Move window to workspace
- `Super + Ctrl + Left/Right` → Navigate between workspaces
- `Super + Ctrl + Shift + Left/Right` → Move window between workspaces

### **Monitor Management:**

- `Alt + Return` → Send window to next monitor
- `Super + Ctrl + Left/Right` → Switch between monitors
